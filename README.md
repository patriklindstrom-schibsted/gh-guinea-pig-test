# gh-guinea-pig-test
This repos is just to make simple smoke test that GitHub seems ok. To be used eg after update of GitHub Enterprise

Example of test: 
* Can we commit? yes try again
* Can we clone?
* Can we make a pull request? will try
I will def test darkmode
Elastic search was a wild ride see : [CHG271942] We will restart Elastic Search engine on GitHub Server and gather more stats
