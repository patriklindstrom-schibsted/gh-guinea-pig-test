# gh-guinea-pig-test
This repos is just to make simple smoke test that GitHub seems ok. To be used eg after update of GitHub Enterprise

Example of test: 
* Can we commit? yes try again
* Can we clone?
* Can we make a pull request? will try
I will def test darkmode
Elastic search was a wild ride see : [CHG271942] We will restart Elastic Search engine on GitHub Server and gather more stats


Ill paste 
Request #1365513 Upgrade from 3.14 to 3.2.1 stuck on migration phase for very long time.
Thanks for the update.

Prod has 40 CPUs, 157GB RAM on AWS (EC2)

The number of resources in your production environment will help but it is also based on the number of workers assigned by your appliance, unfortunately, this will take a similar amount of time in your production environment and if the subset of data is larger it will probably take even more time.

I planned two hours downtime for update in production and I wonder if I must change that value.

The upgrade was successful in your staging environment and it started at Oct 19 17:08:07 and finished at Oct 19 23:15:55 taking approximately 6 hours, if the amount of data in your production environment is the same we would recommend planning 6-8 hours maintenance window just in case you encounter any further issues.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Diego
